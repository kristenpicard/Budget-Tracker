# Online/Offline Budget Tracker

## Description

In this project I wanted to add functionality to an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

The user is able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

Offline Functionality:

- Enter deposits offline

- Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

- Offline entries should be added to tracker.

## Technologies Used

This full-stack web application uses IndexedDB, MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, and NodeJS.
